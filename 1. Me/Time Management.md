## 21 Key Time Management Principles

### 1. Goals
- Core of time management
- Three major areas:
  - Personal and family goals 
  - Business/career/financial goals
  - Self-development goals
- Key questions to ask:
  - What would you do with $1 million?
  - What would you do with 6 months to live?
  - What would you do if you couldn't fail?
- Must be in writing

### 2. Organized Plans of Action
- Action without planning causes failure
- Write out every step
- Organize steps by priority
- Master skill of success
- Continuous planning and organizing

### 3. Analysis & Lists
- Make lists before tasks (+25% productivity)
- When to make lists:
  - Weekly (Sunday/Saturday)
  - Daily (evening before)
- Benefits:
  - Subconscious processing during sleep
  - Provides direction
  - Allows priority analysis
  - Gives sense of accomplishment

### 4. Setting Priorities
- Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)
  - 80% value in 20% of activities
- Focus on vital few vs. trivial many
- Key question: "What is most valuable use of my time?"
- Test: Impact on future

### 5. Concentration
