Medicated Shampoos: Continue using ketoconazole shampoo or try other anti-dandruff shampoos containing zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, or coal tar. These can help reduce dandruff and potentially minimize hair fall associated with it.


2. Scalp Treatment: Regularly massage the scalp with essential oils like tea tree oil, peppermint oil, or rosemary oil, which may promote hair growth and improve scalp health.


3. Nutrition: Ensure a balanced diet rich in vitamins (like biotin and vitamin D), minerals (like zinc and iron), and proteins, as these are essential for healthy hair growth.


4. Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water to keep the scalp and hair hydrated.
