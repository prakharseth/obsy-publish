[[Diet Plan]] (Vegan, [[Caloric Surplus]])

Your goal is to consume 2,300-2,500 calories/day to support muscle gain and healthy weight increase.

To help with digestion and weight gain, take the supplement as follows:

1. Mix with Warm Milk: Blend 2 spoons with a glass of warm milk. Warm milk can make it easier to digest and provide extra calories.


2. Timing: Take it after breakfast or in the evening as a snack, so it doesn’t interfere with your main meals.


3. Slowly Increase Amount: Start with 1 spoon daily for a few days to let your body adjust, then increase to 2 spoons as tolerated.

Timeframe:
Following this plan consistently, you can aim to gain 0.5-1 kg per week, which means you could reach your target weight of 58-60 kg in 10-15 weeks.
