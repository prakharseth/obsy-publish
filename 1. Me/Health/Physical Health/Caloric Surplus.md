You can make a homemade weight gain supplement with simple, affordable, and natural ingredients. Here's a recipe idea that combines nutrients for energy, protein, and healthy fats:

Ingredients:

1. Roasted Gram Flour (Sattu) - 3 tbsp (protein and carbs)


2. Oats - 2 tbsp (fiber and carbs)


3. Almonds or Peanuts - 5-6 pieces, ground (healthy fats and protein)


4. Flaxseeds - 1 tsp (omega-3 and fiber)


5. Milk Powder (optional) - 1-2 tbsp for added creaminess and calories


6. Jaggery or Honey - for natural sweetness and extra calories



Instructions:

1. Blend the oats, almonds (or peanuts), and flaxseeds into a fine powder.


2. Combine with roasted gram flour and milk powder (if using).


3. Store the mixture in an airtight container.



How to Use:

Mix 2 tablespoons with warm milk or water.

Drink it once daily, ideally post-breakfast or in the evening for better digestion and weight gain.


This alternative is nutrient-dense, easier to digest, and more affordable than many store-bought supplements.
