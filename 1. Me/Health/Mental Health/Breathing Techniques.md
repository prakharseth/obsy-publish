### How-to 
1. Diaphragmatic Breathing (Belly Breathing):
Sit or lie down comfortably. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Inhale deeply through your nose, letting your belly rise. Exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your belly fall. Repeat for 5-10 minutes. This helps in calming the mind and improving digestion.


2. Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana):
Sit in a comfortable position. Close your right nostril with your thumb and inhale deeply through your left nostril. Then close your left nostril with your ring finger and exhale through your right nostril. Inhale again through your right nostril, close it, and exhale through your left nostril. Repeat for 5-10 cycles. This balances your nervous system and reduces stress.


3. Box Breathing:
Sit upright and close your eyes. Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 seconds, hold the breath for 4 seconds, exhale slowly for 4 seconds, and hold your breath again for 4 seconds. Repeat this process for a few minutes. It helps in calming anxiety and promoting relaxation.


4. Mindful Eating:
Before starting your meal, take a few deep breaths to calm yourself. Focus on each bite, chew slowly, and avoid distractions like TV or mobile phones. This allows you to enjoy your food more and aids in better digestion.


5. Breath Awareness:
Sit quietly and close your eyes. Simply observe your breathing without trying to change it. Notice the inhale and exhale, the rhythm of your breath. Doing this for a few minutes can relax your mind and help reset your nervous system, improving digestion and mental clarity.
